## Overview:
Here you will find skills and systems I have gained knowledge of over the course of working in the IT field.

## <ins>Endpoint and Application Deployment</ins>
### *MicroSoft SCCM* - 
* Implemented SCCM into the company as part of a team.
* Deploy desktops and laptops via the Task Sequence.
* Deploy software through the distribution task and through the Software Center.
* Deploy scripts to our endpoints for reasons like registry/reboots/OS settings
* Pull reports for asset management.
* Upgrade the SCCM console as needed.

### *MicroSoft Intune* - 
I helped implement InTune to manage our mobile devices in the company. This required creating compliance policies, configuration profiles, and conditional access policies to secure company data on mobile devices.
### *IGEL / UMS* - 
Implemented the IGEL platform into our company. Over the years, I have updated and maintained the platform by updating OS versions, console versions, updated device policies, and new hardware models.
### *ManageEngine Tools* - 
This tool was brought in by the Core Infrastructure team but i was able to get access to AD Audit Plus, AD Manager Plus, M365 Manager Plus. I've used these tools to help troubleshoot user account/active directory issues.

## <ins>Endpoint Security</ins>
### *Group Policy* - 
I create and have a hand in all group policies that are created and affect the endpoints. In preparation for our Windows 11 deployment i went through every GPO being applied to endpoints and created 1 single GPO with modern settings. I was able to clean up over 70 outdated, duplicate, or bad GPOs being applied to our endpoints.
### *Local Password Administrator Solution* - 
Helped implement LAPS into our environment. I deploy the software via SCCM both by task sequence and through the software center. I manage the settings for LAPS by group policy.
### *AppLocker* - 
I helped bring AppLocker into our company to help move towards our zero trust policy. We block all applications that run out of AppData and make allowances based on research.
### *MalwareBytes* - 
I brought in MalwareBytes to work alongside Kaspersky AV when Kaspersky was no longer working. MalwareBytes proved to be an effective lateral protection agent, so we've kept it while moving on to CarbonBlack.
### *CarbonBlack* -
